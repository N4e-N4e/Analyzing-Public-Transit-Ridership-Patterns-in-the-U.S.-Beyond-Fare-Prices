# Analyzing Public Transit Ridership Patterns in the U.S. Beyond Fare Prices
Public transportation is a crucial service that provides much-needed mobility in densely populated urban areas. Even with its necessity, several factors influence ridership patterns, with many assuming fare prices to be the sole factor with the most impact. This assumption ended up creating a common myth, causing many to believe that increase in fare prices lends to lower usage of public transportation. But of course, this is far from the truth. Various factors such as the type of service, the size of the service area, and even economic conditions all play a role in shaping travel behavior. 

This analysis aims to explore fare prices along with other influencing factors, such as operating expenses, trip length, service area population, etc., to gain a proper understanding of what truly drives public transportation ridership. By examining these variables, I hope to challenge the existing beliefs and provide valuable insight that can improve transportation services.
